# OsPageReplacement
I made this software for the students who wants to visualize the page replacement steps theoretically. Here 6 algorithms are present. They are:
1. First In First Out
2.least Recently used
3.Most Recently Used
4.Least Frequently Used
5.Most Frequently Used
6.Optimal
A switch case is implemented here to check all these 6 algorithms continuously. Enjoy!
